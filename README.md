    <h5 align="center">Mirror of Nepeta’s Repository</h5>
     <h4 align="center"><i>Since Suka has shut down his mirror of Nepeta’s repository, I’m taking the liberty to re-open a mirror under my GitHub. I’ve considered doing this because many of the tweaks that were in the previous mirror are still working and being used by people. While some have been revamped and updated by other developers, most tweaks remain either perfectly functional or half-functional, hence the reason why I’ve made this mirror.</h4>
<br>
  <li> As Suka said, you can now download Nepeta’s GitHub files (open-source files) off the website via this link: https://chr0nict.github.io/Nepeta-Mirror/nepsgit.7z or https://alexpng.github.io/nepsgit.7z</li>
  <li> If you wish to add this repository to your selected package manager, please add the URL/or visit the URL: https://alexpng.github.io/Nepeta-Mirror/ 
    <h5 align="center"><i>Note: This repository is completely up to date. None of the work supplied in the repository is made by Chr0nicT nor me (alex_png).
